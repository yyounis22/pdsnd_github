## Project Overview

This project focuses on pandas library usage and simple statistics methods to perform descriptive analysis on the bikeshare data from three major U.S. cities - Chicago, Washington, and New York City - to display information such as most popular days or most common stations.
## Datasets
The datasets used for this script contain bike share data for the first six months of 2017.

The data is provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), which is a bike share system provider for many cities in the United States. The data files for all three cities contain the same six columns:
* Start Time
* End Time
* Trip Duration (in seconds)
* Start Station
* End Station
* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also contain the following two columns:
* Gender
* Birth Year

### Project Title
U.S. Bikeshare data analysis

## Statistics Computed

In this project, the code is written to provide the following information:

**1. Popular times of travel** (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
* most common month
* most common day of week
* most common hour of day

**2. Popular stations and trip**
* most common start station
* most common end station
* most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

**3. Trip duration**
* total travel time
* average travel time

**4. User info**
* counts of each user type
* counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
* earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
